# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

## Aim: 
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

## **AI Tools Required**

* **ChatGPT (GPT-5 model)** or equivalent large language model.
* Text editor/word processor for documentation.

## Explanation: 
Define the Two Prompt Types:

Write a basic Prompt: Clear, detailed, and structured prompts that give specific instructions or context to guide the model.
Based on that pattern type refined the prompt and submit that with AI tool.
Get the ouput and write the report.

Prepare Multiple Test Scenarios:
Select various scenarios such as:
Generating a creative story.
Answering a factual question.
Summarizing an article or concept.
Providing advice or recommendations.
Or Any other test scenario
For each scenario, create both a naïve and a basic prompt. Ensure each pair of prompts targets the same task but with different levels of structure.
Run Experiments with ChatGPT:
Input the naïve prompt for each scenario and record the generated response.
Then input the corresponding basic prompt and capture that response.
Repeat this process for all selected scenarios to gather a full set of results.
Evaluate Responses : 
	Compare how ChatGPT performs when given naïve versus basic prompts and analyze the output based on Quality,Accuracy and Depth. Also analyse does ChatGPT consistently provide better results with basic prompts? Are there scenarios where naïve prompts work equally well?
Deliverables:
A table comparing ChatGPT's responses to naïve and basic prompts across all scenarios.
Analysis of how prompt clarity impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of ChatGPT’s outputs.
Summary of findings with insights on how to structure prompts for optimal results when using ChatGPT.


### **Types of Prompts**

1. **Naïve Prompt (Broad/Unstructured):**

   * Short, vague, or general instruction with little to no context.
   * Example: *“Tell me about AI.”*

2. **Basic Prompt (Clear/Structured/Refined):**

   * Detailed and specific instruction with clear context and scope.
   * Example: *“Explain Artificial Intelligence in simple terms, focusing on its applications in daily life such as healthcare, education, and business.”*


## **Methodology**

1. Selected **4 test scenarios**:

   * Generating a creative story
   * Answering a factual question
   * Summarizing a concept
   * Providing advice/recommendations

2. For each scenario:

   * Prepared a naïve prompt (unstructured).
   * Prepared a basic prompt (structured).
   * Recorded ChatGPT’s responses.

3. Evaluated responses on:

   * **Quality** (clarity, coherence, language use)
   * **Accuracy** (correctness of facts, alignment with task)
   * **Depth** (detail, completeness, richness of information).

| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Creative Story**        | Generic short story, lacked detail, no strong ending.                         | Rich fantasy setting, descriptive, surprising twist, structured ending.                                      | Basic prompt improved *quality* (better language), *depth* (creative details). |
| **Factual Question**      | Gave a technical, textbook-style definition of entanglement (hard to follow). | Used analogy (pair of dice, twins separated), simplified explanation, concise.                               | Basic prompt improved *accuracy for audience* and *clarity*.                   |
| **Summarization**         | Long, general explanation with no focus.                                      | Concise, covered causes, effects, and a solution in under 100 words.                                         | Basic prompt improved *depth* (covered key points) and *quality* (organized).  |
| **Advice/Recommendation** | Very broad (work hard, follow your passion).                                  | Specific roadmap: skills (Python, ML), resources (Coursera, Kaggle), career roles (AI Engineer, Researcher). | Basic prompt improved *accuracy* and *usefulness*.                             |


## **Analysis**

* **Naïve Prompts:**

  * Often produced vague, generic, or overly broad answers.
  * Limited detail and sometimes less audience-appropriate.

* **Basic Prompts:**

  * Produced **clearer, structured, more detailed, and more relevant answers.**
  * Better alignment with the user’s expectations.
  * Higher quality in terms of readability and usefulness.

* **Consistency:**

  * Across all scenarios, **basic prompts consistently outperformed naïve prompts**.
  * However, in very simple factual queries (*e.g., “What is 2+2?”*), naïve prompts can still produce correct results.

## **Summary of Findings**

1. Prompt clarity directly impacts the quality, accuracy, and depth of AI-generated responses.
2. Naïve prompts → Generic, vague, sometimes confusing results.
3. Basic prompts → Focused, structured, more informative, and task-specific outputs.
4. For creative, advisory, or explanatory tasks, refined prompts are essential for optimal results.
5. Good prompt design is a skill: the more specific and structured the prompt, the better the AI performs.


## **Result**

The experiment on prompt comparison was executed successfully.
It is observed that **basic (structured) prompts lead to superior outputs** in terms of quality, accuracy, and depth compared to naïve prompts.
